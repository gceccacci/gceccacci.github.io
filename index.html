                        &emsp;&emsp;My name is Gianluca Ceccacci. I am 20 years old, from Windsor, ON, currently living in Toronto, ON. Here, I am pursuing my

                        and mathematics, I am particularly passionate about visual arts, music, and the integration of these factors that have guided my life.
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;As a kid, I always liked trying new things and challenging myself with fun hobbies. 
                        This includes a love for food, built up during my youth, especially pizza. 
                        My younger self was constantly obsessed with technical perfection, especially seen in my participation as a violinist 
                        for the Windsor Symphony Youth Orchestra and my constant drive to perfect technical skills in my visual arts. 
                        This desire for perfection also carried over to academics and academic extracurriculars such as robotics, 
                        where my team was able to win second place in a provincial level lego robotics competition in the seventh grade. 
                        Although this is an insignificant accomplishment, it was a pretty formative moment in my appreciation for engineering, 
                        and my decision to come to UofT's Engineering Science program, and ultimately pursue growth as an engineer. 
                        It was one of the first moments I ever recall witnessing a rewarding product from hard work.
                    
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;By high school, I became obsessed with refining my creative visions. 
                        During the pandemic, I started creating a lot of visual art -- more than ever before. 
                        I always enjoyed drawing throughout grade school, but this enjoyment flourished into a love once 
                        I was able to dedicate a lot of time to the self expression it provided. 
                        I began studying artists' works and various animated films. I really tried to push my boundaries from technical 
                        illustrations to traditional processes to extremely personal subject matter based sculptures. 
                        Outside of my hobbies, I got a job at a local pizzeria. After a couple promotions, 
                        I was finally at the level to make the pizza I always enjoyed and always will enjoy. 
                        Spending around 25-30 hours a week at this establishment, the community and food itself became a 
                        big part of my life. I was able to build my social skills here with customer service, as well as learn the importance 
                        of the employer-employee relationship. I always made an effort to incorporate my personality and interests into the job, 
                        such as showing younger customers magic tricks. 
            

                
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;Now in university, I am focused on combining both the the technical and the creative in engineering, 
                        a profession that permits for that so beautifully. With my artistic background, design has always been valued highly. 
                        Conversely, I have always noticed strong elements of engineering in my art, such as iterative processes in my workflow or 
                        the scientific reasoning as to why some art pieces work. 
                        Additionally, I am able to relay information and make use of my customer service skills sharpened at the pizzeria. Overall, 
                        it is my ultimate goal to use engineering designas an outlet of self expression, similar to visual arts, in order to benefit others.

                        This year's challenge incorporate's data collection on a glider payload's descent, and an egg drop at a targeted GPS cooardinate simulating satelite instrument deposit. 
                        This design team has furthered my expertise in CAD, PCB design, and CFD analysis.
